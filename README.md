Split the Bill

# Overview
This project implements a recursive algorithm to split a restaurant bill between two people based on predefined payment amounts. The bill is divided into items, and the program determines which items each person should pay for. The project uses custom data structures like UniqueOrderedList and implements a copyable iterator for list traversal.

# Features
Recursive bill splitting algorithm: Determines item assignments to match target payment amounts.
Unique Ordered List with Iterators: Manages the list of bill items while ensuring no duplicates.
Copyable Iterator: Allows for multiple iterations from the same point in the list.

# Classes
UniqueOrderedList.java: An ordered list that maintains unique elements.
UOLIterator.java: Implements an iterator for the ordered list, including a copyable version.
BillSplitter.java: Implements the recursive algorithm to split the bill.
